			<p>Signe Elvira Elgh was born into a family that managed Loka Brunn. She later became a hairdresser and had her own hair salon. Ever the forward-thinking woman she had a child and raised him alone, self-archived for posterity because she knew her life and experiences as an unmarried woman mattered, keeping photo memories of her life experiences and loved ones; and recording an oral herstory before her death hoping that it would share her life and times with her two grandsons.  </p>

			<h3>Self-Archiving The Independent Woman</h3>
			<p>This project has relevance to the reparative LIS community; the LGBTQ for work that has been done by non-binary archivist and lesbians, and for its representation-is-not-gender approach to photo description; to the feminist community for representation of a single mother self-archiving; to the local Swedish community and historical societies; to genealogists and family historians; to the Swedish photography community and critical photo metadata community.</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>The aim is to digitally preserve through digital scanning; to create rich metadata for the photographs; to create machine-readable metadata; to make the digitizations and metadata findable and accessible to machines and humans; to present the digital reproductions and metadata in a critical, interpretive, and aesthetically thoughtful way for human perusal.</p>
			<p>The purpose of the project is to digitally preserve and present the photo albums of Signe Elvira Elgh b. 1900 in Molkom, Sweden; to provide the communities of Molkom, Loka, Grythyttan, Kristinehamn with an archival record of its inhabitants from the early 1900’s; to preserve the visual history of these communities; and to demonstrate critical and interpretive digitization best practices.</p>

			<h3>Source Material</h3>
			<p>Vira, as Elvira was affectionately known, had several photo albums and a collection of photos. This particular album is one of Elvira Elgh’s schoolmates (and occasional friend and relative) from Kristinehamns Praktiska-skola from 1917-1918. The album is [description here]</p>
			<p> this album was given to Per Ingemar Elgh upon his mother Signe Elvira Elgh’s death in 1988. Per Elgh kept them until his death in 2014. They were then passed to his son Per Mathias Elgh and his then-wife Nicc Elgh in 2015. Nicc initially requested the photos while searching for photos to create Per Ingemar Elgh’s funeral program</p>

			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>

			<h3>Project Work</h3>
			<p>GIMP was used to edit the embedded photo metadata. Types included GIMP Description, IPTC, XMP, EXIF. Metadata was exported from GIMP to XML. The metadata was also browsed using ExifTool. Interoperability between IPTC and Dublin Core is currently between Title, Subject/Keywords, Creator, Rights/Copyright Notice, and Description. </p>
			<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
			<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
			<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="/pages/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
